# DeepLearning.Ai Deep Learning course
Programming assignments of Deep Learning, deeplearning.ai (Coursera) taught by Andrew Ng. Try to solve all the assignments by yourself first, but if you get stuck somewhere then feel free to browse the code.

# Content 
1. Introduction to Deep Learning: Analyze the major trends driving the rise of deep learning, and give examples of where and how it is applied today.
2. Neural Networks Basics: Set up a machine learning problem with a neural network mindset and use vectorization to speed up your models.
3. Shallow Neural Networks: Build a neural network with one hidden layer, using forward propagation and backpropagation.
4. Deep Neural Networks: Analyze the key computations underlying deep learning, then use them to build and train deep neural networks for computer vision tasks.
